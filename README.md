# Bellabeat Data Cleaning with SQL & BigQuery
Overview
This repository contains SQL scripts and queries designed to clean and preprocess the raw Bellabeat dataset using Google BigQuery. The cleaned data is further organized and analyzed with Google Sheets to support data exploration and reporting.

Project Context
Bellabeat is a wellness-focused smart device brand that collects detailed health and activity data. This project is part of a broader data analysis case study to extract actionable insights from Bellabeat’s raw data. Effective data cleaning and transformation are essential to ensure accurate analysis and reporting.

What’s Included
SQL Scripts for BigQuery: Queries to handle missing values, remove duplicates, filter erroneous records, and format data consistently.

Data Transformation: Structured queries to prepare the dataset for downstream analysis.

Google Sheets Integration: Cleaned data can be exported or connected to Google Sheets for visualization, dashboards, and collaborative analysis.

Documentation: In-line comments explaining the cleaning logic and transformation steps.

Why Data Cleaning?
Raw datasets often contain inconsistencies, incomplete entries, and errors that can mislead analysis. Cleaning ensures high data quality and reliability, enabling precise insights and better decision-making.

How to Use
Import the raw Bellabeat dataset into Google BigQuery.

Execute the provided SQL queries in BigQuery to clean and preprocess the data.

Export the cleaned data or connect BigQuery directly to Google Sheets for further analysis and visualization.

Utilize the cleaned data for exploratory analysis, reporting, or advanced modeling.
